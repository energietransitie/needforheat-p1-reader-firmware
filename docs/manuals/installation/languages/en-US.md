_The P1 port is located on the front or bottom of many smart meters. Sometimes there is an easily removable cover in front of it._

If there is already a cable plugged into the P1 port, unplug it and plug it in the free connector of the splitter.

Insert the free connector of the short black cable into the P1 port of your smart electricity meter.

You should feel a distinct click, indicating that the plug is properly connected.  

Find a stable place for your smart meter module.

## 3. Plug in the power cord.

Plug the power adapter into an available electrical outlet near your smart meter.
