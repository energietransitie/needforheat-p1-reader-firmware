			<p>
				<i>Scroll down for more!</i>
			</p> 
			<br>
			<p>
				<i>Do not press the green button at the bottom of this screen immediately, but make sure you have connected and installed the p1-reader first.</i>

			<p>
				You have just scanned the QR code of a Twomes p1-reader. Above, you can see a photo of the p1-reader. You may have also received a splitter (bottom left) and a USB power adapter (bottom right).
			</p>
			<p>
				We will provide you with instructions on how to install the device with your smart meter. If you have any questions after reading these instructions, please first check the <a href="../../assendorp2021/FAQ/index.html">FAQ</a> section. There you will also find information on how to get assistance if you are unable to proceed.
			</p>

            <h2>1. Connect the USB power adapter if necessary</h2>
			<p>For the most modern smart meters, the p1-reader is powered by the smart meter itself. Older models require an external power adapter.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you have received 2 USB power adapters from us, use one of them for the p1-reader.</li>
				<li>If you have received 1 USB power adapter from us, it depends on whether you have also received an OpenTherm Monitor from us (a small white box with 2 green screw terminal connectors).</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you have received an OpenTherm Monitor, use the USB power adapter for that.</li>
					<li>If you have not received an OpenTherm Monitor, then you should connect the USB power adapter to the p1-reader.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>If you have not received a USB power adapter from us, it means that we have detected that your smart meter is of the modern type that can provide sufficient power for the p1-reader.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>If</b> the USB power adapter is required for the smart meter, insert the micro-USB plug into the side of the p1-reader (it only fits one way), connect the USB plug to the power adapter, and finally plug the power adapter into an available electrical outlet near your smart meter.
			</p>
            <h2>2. Connect the P1 cable</h2>
				Insert the detachable plug of the p1-reader into the P1 port of your smart meter. You should feel a distinct click, indicating that the plug is properly connected.<br>
				<div class="image-block" >
					<img src="../images/P1MeterEnexis.png" />
				</div>
                <i>The P1 port is located on the front or bottom of many smart meters. Sometimes there is an easily removable cover in front of it.</i>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>If</b> your P1 port is already occupied, use the supplied splitter: first remove the plug that occupies the P1 port, then insert the detachable plug of the splitter into the P1 port, and finally insert the two detachable plugs into the 2 available ports of the splitter.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Do not place the p1-reader right next to your Wi-Fi router, as it may interfere with communication with the other modules later on.
            </p>
			<br>
            <p>
				<i>You have connected the p1-reader.</i>
			</p>
			<h2>3. Enable Bluetooth</h2>
			<p>Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your smartphone. This is required for the next step.</p>
			<br>
            <p>
				<i>Proceed with the "Ok, I've done it" button below in the app to complete the installation of the p1-reader.</i>
